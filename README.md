# Instagram Clone App

This is a clone of the popular social media app Instagram, developed using React Native. The app includes a simplified version of the main feed and search functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with this app, first clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/kadiraydinli/instagramClone.git
```

Next, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using Yarn:

```
cd instagram-clone && yarn
```

Before running the app, you will also need to create a `.env` file by copying the provided `.env.example` file:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the new `.env` file in your preferred text editor and enter your own API keys and other required information. The `API_URL` is included in the `.env` file and can be edited to customize the URL as needed.

## Running the App

To run the app on an Android device or emulator, run the following command:

```
yarn android
```

To run the app on an iOS device or simulator, run the following command:

```
yarn ios
```

This will launch the app on your device or simulator and provide you with additional information and options for testing and debugging.
